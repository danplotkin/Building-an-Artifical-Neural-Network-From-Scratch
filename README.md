# Building-an-Artifical-Neural-Network-From-Scratch

In this project, I will be implementing a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch with NumPy for the Iris dataset. I will describe the architecture of an ANN and the math that high-leveled libraries like Keras and Pytorch perform in the background.
